This is the library catalog app, based on the "Getting Started" sample app (http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)
Uses nested resources with "books" belonging to "authors"
Essentially a modified version of the "Getting Started" blog app with "authors" taking the place of posts and "books" taking the place of comments.
